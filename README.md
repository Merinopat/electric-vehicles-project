This project compares the energy performance of Electric Vehicles (EVs), Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles, and Hybrids using Python Jupyter notebooks and drive cycle data.
It simulates and analyzes how each vehicle type behaves under various driving conditions, modeling factors like battery state-of-charge, regenerative braking, and hybrid energy split.

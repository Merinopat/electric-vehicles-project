This project compares the energy performance of Electric Vehicles (EVs), Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles, and Hybrids drive cycle data.

It was developed as part of the coursework for the EE4513 â€“ Electric Vehicles and their Grid Integration module at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

The project simulates how each vehicle type behaves under realistic driving conditions, modeling factors like battery state-of-charge (SOC), regenerative braking, and hybrid energy split, while providing visualization and comparison tools.

The code is dicided into two parts extraction (data.ipynb) and evaluation (workbook.ipynb).
The project paper can be found in the paper folder.
